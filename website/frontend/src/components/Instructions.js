          This study is part of a project in which we want to assess the
		  complexity and understandability of German text paragraphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will read texts and answer questions about the
          complexity and understandability. Each survey will take about {SESSION_DURATION} minutes to
          complete and consists of two paragraphs, for each of which you will be
          led through the following three steps:
        </p>
        <h5>1. Reading</h5>
        <p>
          In the first step you can <strong>read the text</strong> that you will
          be rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will measure how long it takes to read a paragraph, so the
          text will be hidden unless you hold a button below the text. Please
          make sure you read the entire paragraph and understand it as well as
          you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you are done, click on "Next Step".{' '}
          <strong>
            After that, you will not be able to go back to read the text.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <h5>2. Questions</h5>
        <p>
          In the second step you will be asked{' '}
          <strong>questions about the text</strong>, for example how complex you
          think it is or how well you understood it.
        </p>
        <h5>3. Cloze Test</h5>
        <p>
          In the last step you will see the text again, but with several words
          left out. Please <strong>select the missing words</strong> from the
          dropdown menus.
        </p>
        <h5>Finish</h5>
        <p>
          After you complete the rating for one text, you will get the next 
		  paragraph and can start the rating of that text. After
          completing both texts of a survey, your answers will be saved and you
          will be redirected to the homepage.
        </p>
        <h5>Compensation</h5>
        <p>
          After completing a session you will get a code. Please fill in this code in 
		  the Microworker's campaign to prove a successfully completed job.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> There are{' '}
          <strong>no right or wrong answers</strong> as long as you read the
          text carefully, follow the instructions and give your honest opinion.
          In case you get tired or cannot focus for any reason, take a break and
          come back later.
